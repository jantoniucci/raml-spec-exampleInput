This is a RAML spec proposal to optionally define the inputs that produces the example.

These inputs could be uriParam, queryParam, header, body.

The proposal is implemented and currently used as an annotation but should be considered to be included as  an example's property.

Specifying the inputs for an example is specially usefull to show expected response but also to feed a mock server.

Please, star and feel free to contribute.
